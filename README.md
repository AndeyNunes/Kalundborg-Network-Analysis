# Kalundborg Network Analysis

This project uses a class paper from Spring 2017 SySc510 Network Analysis as the basis for an exploration of network features of the industrial symbiosis development in Kalundborg, Denmark. The paper uses several other journal articles as a basis for reproducing prior work and then expanding on previous network analysis.

Coding is in R-Markdown.
